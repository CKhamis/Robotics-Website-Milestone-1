# Apes of Wrath Website Project
This project was commisioned by my highschool robotics team in order to revamp our previous website. After taking over as the lead web captain of the team, I decided to create a dedicated website using HTML, CSS, and JS. While many of the features were taken from the previous website, I made sure to add in some features of my own.

## Categories
A feature I added to the robotics website were dedicated pages for each sub group in our team. I called this feature categories. Each page featured information about the sub group you were viewing.

## Animated Banners
One of the constraints I was given to make the website was adding in banners on all pages that features our logo. I did this by first animating them in Adobe Flash, exporting them into HTML files, and embedding them into each webpage. Many of the pages have their own unique animations.
